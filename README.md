# Homeflix
A very simple script that combines powerful tools such as peerflix, subliminal to provide a better viewing experience with subtitles being automatically downloaded. 

# Install
```
npm install -g peerflix
npm install parse-torrent -g
sudo pip install subliminal
```

# Run
For simplicity i run using vlc only. Make sure it is installed, otherwise you can modify the script to change to other player. 
```
./homeflix "MAGNET LINK"
```
